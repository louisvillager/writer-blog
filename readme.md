# A Writer's Corner
## A personal blog by Marc Rivers

---

This is my personal blog, which also doubles as an experimental laboratory/showcase for front-end web development skills. I'll use this space to share part of myself while also brushing up on website design.

Could I have just used Wix or Squarespace or something to make a blog? Yes. Is it slightly more rewarding to see how much I can do from scratch? Also yes.

**What's here?**

Subsections include:
- Fiction writing
- General blog
- Woodworking blog
