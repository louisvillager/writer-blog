      <!-- Site Description -->
      <h3 class="intro" id="intro-where">Where Is This?</h3>
      <p>
        This is my blog. So, welcome! It's also something of a professional
        portfolio, with fiction writing and web development samples. There are
        also random thought salads here and there, because why not. It's my
        site.
      </p>

      <!---- Personal Bio ---->
      <h3 class="intro" id="intro-who">Who Are You?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm Marc Rivers. I'm also Mary's fiancé. I grew up in and lived most of
        my life in Louisville, Kentucky (moving back and forth between here and
        other places on occasion). I'm a lifelong fan of fantasy stories in
        book, visual, and video game media. Writing fiction has long been a
        hobby, and now I'm fighting the Sisyphean battle against my own reserved
        nature to share it with the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently live in Louisville with a 12-pound housecat named after a
        Norse dragon.
      </p>

      <!---- What I Write ---->
      <h3 class="intro" id="intro-what">What Do You Do?</h3>
      <p>
        I write fantasy fiction. My stories are predominantly set in the world
        of Estéa, where magic, wars, and migrations have shaped the land. I like
        to focus on heroes, hapless victims, and the occasional streetwise
        opportunist as they brave a dangerous land.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently working toward publishing my first novel, "Songs of the
        Eyldrmen".
        <!-- Link the book title to the NOVELS page -->
      </p>
      <p>
        I also do woodworking, painting miniature figurines, and playing
        tabletop RPGs when I can find a group for once. Poke around the site for
        some examples!
      </p>

      <!---- Contact Info ---->
      <h3 class="intro" id="intro-how">How Do I Contact You?</h3>
      <p>That's the neat part&mdash;you don't!</p>
      <p>
        Well, not yet, anyway. I have a presence on multiple social media
        platforms, believe it or not. But only my professional accounts will be
        shared here as they're created. Personal accounts are mine to give out
        and mine alone. (See the reference earlier to being reserved.)
