    <h3 class="intro" id="intro-where">Where Is This?</h3>
    <p>
      This is my blog. So, welcome! It's also something of a professional
      portfolio, with fiction writing and web development samples. There are
      also random thought salads here and there, because why not. It's my site.
    </p>

    <!---- Personal Bio ---->
    <h3 class="intro" id="intro-who">Who Are You?</h3>
    <p>
      I'm Marc Rivers. I'm also Mary's fiancé. I grew up in and lived most of my
      life in Louisville, Kentucky (moving back and forth between here and other
      places on occasion). I'm a lifelong fan of fantasy stories in book,
      visual, and video game media. Writing fiction has long been a hobby, and
      now I'm fighting the Sisyphean battle against my own reserved nature to
      share it with the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently live in Louisville with a 12-pound housecat named after a
      Norse dragon.
    </p>

    <!---- What I Write ---->
    <h3 class="intro" id="intro-what">What Do You Do?</h3>
    <p>
      I write fantasy fiction. My stories are predominantly set in the world of
      Estéa, where magic, wars, and migrations have shaped the land. I like to
      focus on heroes, hapless victims, and the occasional streetwise
      opportunist as they brave a dangerous land.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently working toward publishing my first novel, "Songs of the
      Eyldrmen".
      <!-- Link the book title to the NOVELS page -->
    </p>
    <p>
      I also do woodworking, painting miniature figurines, and playing tabletop
      RPGs when I can find a group for once. Poke around the site for some
      examples!

    <!---- Contact Info ---->
    <h3 class="intro" id="intro-how">How Do I Contact You?</h3>
    <p>That's the neat part&mdash;you don't!</p>
    <p>
      Well, not yet, anyway. I have a presence on multiple social media
      platforms, believe it or not. But only my professional accounts will be
      shared here as they're created. Personal accounts are mine to give out and
      mine alone. (See the reference earlier to being reserved.)
